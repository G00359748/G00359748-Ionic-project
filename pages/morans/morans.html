    A piece on Moran's Bar

    <p>
        Morans Bar is the best pub that serves the nicest pint of Guinness in Carna.Even one of the National Papers the Sunday World gave the Pint a four out of five star rating on it's pub spy column back in 2009.That was a very good rating considering that the person writing the column was travelling around the country trying to find the best pint of Guinness in this Isle.Peter Fitzpatrick is the main man in the pub and has been running it for over twenty years and the barmaid Mary Hopkins has been working there for over fourty years.Those are the main two people that would be working if you were to go in for a drink and the are very welcoming to any person who visits the pub.
